# Contracts

Five plain-data formats. Code on either side of a contract can change freely; a contract changes only with its
`schema_version`, and every file is checked against its schema before it is used.

| Contract | Format | Schema | Written by | Read by |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Mark profile** | YAML | `ptmcontext/schemas/profile.schema.json` | a person | the layers (motifs), the tests (residues, words) |
| **Site** | YAML | `ptmcontext/schemas/site.schema.json` | a person | `ptmc run` |
| **Input manifest** | JSON | `ptmcontext/schemas/inputs.schema.json` | `ptmc stage`, `ptmc inputs record` | every build |
| **Unit table** | TSV | `ptmcontext/schemas/units.schema.json` | stagers, other repositories | the layers |
| **Statistics row** | TSV | `ptmcontext/schemas/statistics.schema.json` | every test | releases, websites, parity |

## Statistics row

The columns, their order and their formatting are those of the Methylarginine Site Explorer's
`statistics_<version>.tsv`, unchanged: `analysis, category, stratum, a, b, c, d, odds_ratio, log2_odds_ratio,
fold_enrichment, log2_fold_enrichment, p, q, method, background, n_strata, odds_ratio_ci_low, odds_ratio_ci_high`.
Integers without decimals, numbers in up to 6 significant digits, empty for missing.

Conventions:

- `fisher`: pooled 2x2 test; Haldane–Anscombe odds ratio (0.5 added to each cell), two-sided Fisher p.
- `mantel_haenszel`: each protein a stratum; Mantel–Haenszel odds ratio, Robins–Breslow–Greenland 95% CI, the
  continuity-corrected CMH statistic floored at 0 (a count within 0.5 of its expectation gives p = 1).
- Both count the same marks: those on a protein with at least one other candidate residue.
- `q`: Benjamini–Hochberg within (analysis, method).
- An effect is reported at q ≤ 0.05 and at least 1.1× either way.

## Unit table

`unit_id, accession, start, end, kind, source`, then the unit's own columns. 1-based, inclusive, on the snapshot's
sequences. Domain units add `subtype` (domain, repeat), `ref` (the source's accession), `label` (its name) and
`members` (member-database accessions).

## Marks

Any TSV with an accession column and a position column; the site file names them and selects rows with `include` and
`exclude` conditions (`equals`, `in`, `contains`). Positions must be on the snapshot's sequences.
